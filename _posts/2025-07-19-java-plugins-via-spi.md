The easiest way to enable extensibility in your Java application via plugins is by using the **Service Provider Interface (SPI)**. This functionality has been built into Java since version 6 and is widely adopted by popular frameworks and libraries such as Spring and Maven.

## How Does It Work?

You define interfaces or abstract classes designed for extensibility. Concrete implementations can then be provided externally, typically discovered and loaded dynamically at runtime.

Below, we outline the key steps to create and integrate a plugin in your Java application.

## Step-by-step Example

### 1. Create an API Module and Define the Interface

The API module acts as a contract or specification that plugins will implement.

```java
package com.example.log;

public interface Logger {
    void log(String message);
}
```


### 2. (Optional) Provide a Default Logger Implementation

```java
package com.example.log;

public class DefaultLogger implements Logger {

    @Override
    public void log(String message) {
        System.out.println(message);
    }
}
```


### 3. Load the Implementation Dynamically in the API Module

```java
package com.example.log;

import java.util.ServiceLoader;

public class LoggerFactory {

    public static Logger getLogger() {
        ServiceLoader<Logger> serviceLoader = ServiceLoader.load(Logger.class);
        
        // Use the first available implementation; fallback to DefaultLogger if none found
        return serviceLoader.findFirst().orElseGet(DefaultLogger::new);
    }
}
```


### 4. Create a Plugin Module

In your plugin module, add the API module as a dependency, and implement the `Logger` interface:

```java
package com.external.log;

import com.example.log.Logger;

public class ExternalLogger implements Logger {

    @Override
    public void log(String message) {
        System.out.println("External logger: " + message);
    }
}
```


### 5. Register the Implementation in `/src/main/resources/META-INF/services`

Create a file named exactly as the fully qualified interface name in the folder:

```
/src/main/resources/META-INF/services/com.example.log.Logger
```


### 6. Specify Implementation Class Names in the Registration File

List all fully qualified implementation class names in this file. For our example:

```
com.external.log.ExternalLogger
```

If multiple implementations exist, list each one on its own line.

### 7. Build the Plugin JAR and Deploy It

Package the plugin module as a JAR and publish it to your Maven repository or otherwise make it available to your main application.

### 8. Add the Plugin as a Dependency in Your Main Application

Once included as a dependency, your app can discover and utilize the plugin implementation automatically through SPI.

And thatâ€™s it! We've created a clear plugin specification, provided an implementation externally, and integrated that plugin into our main Java application using the Service Provider Interface.
